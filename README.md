# Key Logger

## Overview

This project is a simple key logger built using Python. It records all keypress events and logs them to a text file named `key_log.txt`. The key logger captures both standard alphanumeric keys as well as special keys (like Shift, Ctrl, etc.).

## Features

- **Key Press Logging**: Logs every key press along with a timestamp.
- **Special Key Recognition**: Recognizes and logs special keys (e.g., Shift, Ctrl, etc.).
- **Log File**: Stores the captured keystrokes in a `key_log.txt` file with timestamps.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library (for capturing keyboard events)
